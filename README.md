## Two-Stage CMOS OTA Design (SKY130)

This repository documents the complete design, sizing, and simulation
of a two-stage CMOS operational transconductance amplifier (OTA)
implemented using the SKY130 PDK.

The work focuses on methodical analog design using LUT-based sizing,
stability analysis, and simulation-driven validation.

---

## Design Objectives

- Achieve high DC gain with stable closed-loop operation
- Ensure adequate phase margin under nominal load conditions
- Use gm/Id-based sizing for predictable performance
- Validate design decisions through simulation

---

## Design Methodology

The OTA was designed using a structured workflow:

1. Device-level characterization using ngspice
2. LUT generation for gm/Id, output resistance, and ft
3. Transistor sizing based on target gain and stability
4. Frequency compensation for robust phase margin
5. Iterative AC and transient simulations for verification

Python scripts were used to automate LUT generation and visualize
design trade-offs.

## LUT Generation

Lookup tables were generated by sweeping device operating points
and extracting relevant small-signal parameters.

Generated LUTs include:
- gm/Id vs drain current
- Output resistance vs bias current
- Transition frequency vs operating point

Corresponding plots are provided in `lut_generation/plots`.
